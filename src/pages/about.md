# About Forestry

Lumberjacks are North American workers in the logging industry who
perform the initial harvesting and transport of trees for ultimate
processing into forest products. The term usually refers to a bygone
era (before 1945 in the United States) when hand tools were used in
harvesting trees. Because of its historical ties, the term lumberjac
has become ingrained in popular culture through folklore, mass media
and spectator sports. The actual work was difficult, dangerous,
intermittent, low-paying, and primitive in living conditions. However,
the men built a traditional culture that celebrated strength,
masculinity, confrontation with danger, and resistance to modernization.
